# Markdown-EX

![travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/iwataka/vim-markdown-ex.svg?branch=master)

Extra useful functionalities for markdown editing!

## Introduction

Markdown-style documents now becomes more and more important and many helper
plugins have been created, but they aren't enough intuitive and useful at least
for me. I carefully select really necessary features and implement them in
appropriate way.

## Usage

This provides the below features:

+ Create/Toggle/Remove checkboxes
+ Jump to next/previous links
+ Open links by gx with additional features
+ Text object for fenced code blocks

Please check `:help vim-markdown-ex` to see more details.
